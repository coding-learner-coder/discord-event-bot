# Copy this file to .env and fill in your bot token (don't commit .env)
# IMPORTANT: If your token was previously exposed, regenerate it in the
# Discord Developer Portal before using it here. Treat tokens as secrets.
#
# After regenerating, set the value below (do NOT commit .env into Git).
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
# Optional: enable message content intent for prefix commands
# ENABLE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true

# Deployment notes:
# - On Railway or other hosts, configure an environment variable named
#   `DISCORD_TOKEN` in the project settings instead of committing a `.env` file.
